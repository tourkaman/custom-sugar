# custom-sugar
Custom syntactic sugar for Python. Investigating how to do it.


# Goal

Creating or learning to use a decorator-like notation (markup?) for tying a different supporting file, or just extracting stuff from the bottom of a file, with fragment links to the original docs, as well as original source code line permalink, to make it easier to dig straight in and see what options there are and how the code is going to behave in different conditions.


# Progress so far
